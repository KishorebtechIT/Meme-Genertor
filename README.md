In this project, let's build a **Meme Generator** app by applying the concepts I have learned till now.


<br/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://assets.ccbp.in/frontend/content/react-js/meme-generator-output.gif" alt="meme-generator" style="max-width:70%;box-shadow:0 2.8px 2.2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12)">
</div>

- Initially, values in the inputs elements should be empty and the selected value in the select element should be the first item in the given fontSizesOptionsList
- When non-empty values are provided for **Image Url**, **Top Text**, **Bottom Text**, and **Font Size** and the **Generate** button is clicked
  - The Image URL that has been provided should be applied as a background-image for the generated meme
  - The given Top and Bottom text values should be at the top and bottom of the generated meme
  - The selected font size value should be applied for both top and bottom text of the generated meme
